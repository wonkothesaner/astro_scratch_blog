This is not my first attempt at posting nor at trying to build a website.  I first started out on my journey to understand how best to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to build websites in 2015.  When the world was a very different place:  
- Barack Obama was still President in the US, 
- the Tories were in power in the UK (but held back a little in coalition by the Liberal Democrats), 
- Brexit was a dream for some rather than a reality for all, 
- [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Wikipedia article") was providing the voice for Paddington in movies rather than leading The Ukraine's resistance to Russian agression.

What I learnt or learned (depending on which side of the pond you reside) back then is that there was no single right way to do things.  "It depended" not just on what you want to do but also, very often, what you believed and who you were prepared to listen to.  Many different people seemed to propose many different approaches to achieve the same result.

In short, opinions mattered as much, if not more, than facts.  Partly because Douglas Crockford, primarily (by my observation), had passed comment on the good and bad parts of Javascript.
